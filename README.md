## Project Description

AlumNet is designed to build and maintain a comprehensive database of alumni. This database will help in fostering a strong network among former students and facilitate engagement and collaboration. The data collection is entirely voluntary and aims to respect the privacy and consent of the participants.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project stems from the belief that students greatly benefit from connecting with their alumni. Whether seeking advice on further studies, job recommendations, or finding mentors for our in-house grown clubs, having a robust alumni network can significantly enhance the student experience and career prospects. Additionally, to encourage more alumni to volunteer, we collect their LinkedIn profiles. Filling out professional career details can be long and time-consuming, and since this information is likely already available on their LinkedIn profiles, the project includes a scraping component to streamline data collection.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Securely collect information such as name, roll number, contact info, and LinkedIn profile.
- **Data Scraping**: The data available on the LinkedIn profile is being scraped, cleaned using genai.
- **Database Management**: Efficiently store and manage alumni data.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure the privacy and security of alumni data.
- **Accesibility**: College students can access the website, run queries and find the alumni who can help them the most.
